# Eth_Node_Map

## This repository is an example of an Ethereum Visualization Used for Marketing Purposes.

## Utilizing Folium(<https://pypi.org/project/folium/>), and GeoPandas(<https://geopandas.org/en/stable/#>).. We first reformatted, and then mapped
## latitude, and longitudinal data to produce Ethereum node locations. 

## It can be used to track ethereum usage across the globe.

## It can also be used to determine the potential market adoption of an ethereum based product.

## Think of yourself being in a marketing position at a company like SoFi.. Can you see how this data might be useful to see which regions might be most welcoming of advertisements related to a Cryptocurrency rewards based credit card? amongst many other services!
